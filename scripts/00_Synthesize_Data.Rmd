This RMarkdown document is designed to synthesize an epidemic dataset.

## Load data

```{r}
address.points = st_read(file.path(data.dir, "Address_Points", "Address Points.shp")) %>%
  select(GISID, StrName, Suburb, AddressPnt) %>%
  st_zm(drop = T, what = "ZM")

addresses = address.points %>%
  sample_n(n.households)

occupations = c("Medical", "Admin", "Trades")
workplaces = address.points %>%
  sample_n(n.workplaces) %>%
  mutate(occupations = sample(occupations, n(), replace=T))
```

## Generate people

These are not real people!

```{r}
people = addresses %>%
  # generate names
  mutate(ethnicity = sample(2:6, n.households, replace=T)) %>%
  sample_n(n, replace=T) %>%
  arrange(GISID) %>%
  mutate(full.name = randomNames(1, ethnicity=ethnicity)) %>%
  select(-ethnicity) %>%
  separate(full.name, c("last.name", "first.name"), sep=", ") %>%
  # ensure family name in household
  group_by(GISID) %>%
  mutate(last.name = first(last.name)) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  select(first.name, last.name, everything()) %>%
  # add workplace
  mutate(workplace = sample(workplaces$AddressPnt, n(), replace=T),
         infection.day = NA,
         infection.acquired = NA)
```

## Simulate infection

```{r}
# x[i,j] = partial likelihood of transmission from i to j
x.distance = exp(-st_distance(people) %>% as.numeric / 10000)
x.workplace = outer(people$workplace, people$workplace, function (a, b) a==b) %>% as.numeric
inv.diag = 1 - diag(n)

# define viral shedding as a function of infection day
infection.day = c(0, 2, 5, 14)
infectivity = c(0, 1, 1, 0)
infectivity = approxfun(infection.day, infectivity)
qplot(infection.day, infectivity(infection.day), geom="line")

# initialise
people$infection.day = c(1, rep(NA, n-1))
people$infection.acquired = c(0, rep(NA, n-1))

# importance parameters - arbitrary but choose good values!
b.distance = 5e-3
b.workplace = 5e-3
b.rand = 0

# iterate
for (day in 1:sim.days) {
  infectivity.matrix = replicate(n, infectivity(people$infection.day))
  x.rand = matrix(runif(n*n), n, n)
  likelihood = (b.distance * x.distance + b.workplace * x.workplace + b.rand * x.rand) * infectivity.matrix * inv.diag
  likelihood.sums = colSums(likelihood, na.rm=T)
  likelihood[!is.na(people$infection.day)] = 0  # infected people cannot be reinfected
  infect = likelihood.sums >= sort(likelihood.sums, T)[5]
  infect = likelihood.sums > runif(n)
  people$infection.day[is.na(people$infection.day) & infect] = 0
  people$infection.acquired[is.na(people$infection.acquired) & infect] = day
  people$infection.day = people$infection.day + 1
}

people %>% filter(infection.day > 0)
table(people$infection.acquired)
